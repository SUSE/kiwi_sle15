Development and Contributing
============================

.. hint:: **Abstract**

   This document describes the development process of KIWI
   and how you can be part of it. This description applies
   for version |version|.

The core appliance builder is developed in Python and follows the test
driven development rules.

Fork the upstream KIWI repository
---------------------------------

1. On GitHub, navigate to: https://github.com/SUSE/kiwi

2. In the top-right corner of the page, click :command:`Fork`.

Create a local clone of the forked KIWI repository
--------------------------------------------------

.. code:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/kiwi

    $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/SUSE/kiwi.git

Create a python virtual development environment
-----------------------------------------------

The Python project uses :command:`pyvenv` to setup a development environment
for the desired Python version. The script :command:`pyvenv` is already
installed when using Python 3.3 and higher (see
https://docs.python.org/3.3/whatsnew/3.3.html#pep-405-virtual-environments
for details). For Python 2.7 use :command:`virtualenv`, which is provided
via pip or as an extra package in your favourite Linux distribution.

However, for setting up a Python virtual development environment the
following additional LaTeX, include, header files and compilers are required
in order to allow for compiling the C parts of the runtime required
Python modules:

* XML processing with libxml2 and libxslt (for :mod:`lxml`)
* Foreign function interface library (libffi48)
* Python header files (for :mod:`xattr`)
* GCC compiler and glibc-devel header files
* LaTeX packages for building PDF documentation

.. note::

    On SUSE systems the required components can be installed
    with the following command. Package names and install command
    are different on other systems.

.. code:: bash

    $ zypper install \
        python3-devel libxml2-devel libxslt-devel libffi48-devel \
        glibc-devel gcc texlive-fncychap texlive-wrapfig \
        texlive-capt-of trang

Once the basic python module requirements are installed on your system,
the next step is to create the virtual development environment.
The following procedure describes how to create a Python3 virtual
development environment:

1. Create the virtual environment:

   .. code:: bash

    $ python3 -m venv .env3

2. Activate the virtual environment:

   .. code:: bash

    $ source .env3/bin/activate

3. Install KIWI requirements inside the virtual environment:

   .. code:: bash

    $ pip install -r .virtualenv.dev-requirements.txt

4. Install KIWI in Development Mode:

   .. code:: bash

     $ ./setup.py develop

Once the development environment is activated and initialized with the
project required Python modules, you are ready to work.

The :command:`develop` target of the :command:`setup.py` script
automatically creates the application entry point called :command:`kiwi-ng-3`,
which allows to simply call the application from the code in the
virtual environment:

.. code:: bash

    $ kiwi-ng-3 --help

In order to leave the development mode just call:

.. code:: bash

    $ deactivate

To resume your work, change into your local Git repository and recall:

.. code:: bash

    $ source .env3/bin/activate

If the version has changed by :command:`bumpversion`, this
causes the current entry point to become invalid. Reconstruct the
entry point after a version change by recalling:

.. code:: bash

    $ ./setup.py develop

Running Test Cases
------------------

For running test cases, the preferred method is to use Tox. The Tox
execution environment can be used to run any kind of target, tests are
just one, documentation is another one. Refer to :file:`tox.ini` for more
details. Tox itself creates a python virtual environment for each tox
target below :file:`./.tox`.

Before you start to contribute code make sure all tests pass by calling
the following command:

.. code:: bash

    $ tox

We also include ``pytest-xdist`` in the development virtualenv which allows
to run the unit tests in parallel. It is turned of by default but can be
enabled via:

.. code:: bash

    $ tox "-n NUMBER_OF_PROCESSES"

where you can insert an arbitrary number as ``NUMBER_OF_PROCESSES`` (or a
shell command like ``$(nproc)``). Please also note that the double quotes
around ``-n NUMBER_OF_PROCESSES`` are required (otherwise :command:`tox`
will consume this command line flag instead of forwarding it to
:command:`pytest`).

The previous call would run :command:`tox` for different Python versions,
checks the source code for errors, and builds the documentation.

If you want to see the target, use the option `-l` to print a list:

.. code:: bash

    $ tox -l

To only run a special target, use the `-e` option. The following
example runs the test cases for the 3.6 interpreter only:

.. code:: bash

    $ tox -e 3.6

Create a branch for each feature or bugfix
------------------------------------------

Congratulation ! you successfully created a KIWI development environment
and all tests passed. Now it's time to hack on KIWI. Code changes should
be done in an extra git branch. This allows for creating GitHub pull requests
in a clean way. Also See `Github Issues and Pull Requests <https://help.github.com/en/categories/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests>`__

.. code:: bash

    $ git checkout -b my-topic-branch

Make and commit your changes.

.. note::

    You can make multiple commits which is generally useful to
    give your changes a clear structure and to allow us to better
    review your work effort.

.. note::

    Your work is important and should be signed to ensure the
    integrity of the repository and the code. Thus we recommend
    to setup a signing key as documented in Signing_Git_Patches_.

.. code:: bash

    $ git commit -S -a

Run tests and code style checks. All of these are also performed by
the travis integration test system at the time when a pull request
will be created.

.. code:: bash

    $ tox

Once all is done push your local branch to the forked repository
and head out to GitHub for creating a pull request into the upstream
repository.

.. code:: bash

    $ git push origin my-topic-branch

Thanks much for contributing to KIWI. Your time and work effort is
very much appreciated.

Good to know
------------

The following sections provides further information about repository
integrity, version, package and documentation management and are a good
read to complete the picture of how the KIWI project works.

.. _Signing_Git_Patches:

Signing Git Patches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With ssh keys being widely available and the increasing compute power
available to many people refactoring of SSH keys is in the range of
possibilities. Therefore SSH keys as used by GitHub as a
"login/authentication" mechanism no longer provide the security they
once did. In an effort to ensure the integrity of the repository and
the code base patches sent for inclusion must be GPG signed.

To prepare Git to sign commits, follow these one-time instructions:

1. Create a key suitable for signing (its not recommended to use
   existing keys to not mix it up with your email environment etc):

   .. code:: bash

    $ gpg --gen-key

2. Choose a DSA key (3) with a key size of 2048 bits (default) and a
   validation of 3 years (3y). Enter your name/email and GPG will
   generate a DSA key for you.

   You can also choose to use an empty passphrase, despite GPG's warning,
   because you are only going to sign your public git commits with it and
   don't need it for protecting any of your secrets. That might ease later
   use if you are not using an :command:`gpg-agent` that caches your passphrase
   between multiple signed Git commits.

3. Add the key ID to your git config

   In above case, the ID is 11223344 so you add it to either your global
   :file:`~/.gitconfig` or even better to your :file:`.git/config`
   inside your repo:

   .. code:: ini

    [user]
    name = Joe Developer
    email = developer@foo.bar
    signingkey = 11223344

Raising Versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The KIWI project follows the `Semantic Versioning <https://semver.org>`__
method. To make it easier to follow this method, :command:`bumpversion` is
used as a tool.

Follow these instructions to raise the major, minor, or patch part of a
version:

*  For backwards-compatible bug fixes:

   .. code:: bash

    $ bumpversion patch

*  For additional functionality in a backwards-compatible manner. When
   changed, the patch level is set back to zero:

   .. code:: bash

    $ bumpversion minor

*  For incompatible API changes. When changed, the patch and minor
   levels are set back to zero:

   .. code:: bash

    $ bumpversion major

Creating a Package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The creation of RPM package sources has to be done by calling the
following make target:

.. code:: bash

   $ make build

The sources are collected below the :file:`dist/` directory. In there you
will find all required files to submit a package to the Open Build
Service or just build it with :command:`rpmbuild`.

Building Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The documentation is implemented using Sphinx with the ReST markup. In
order to build the documentation just call:

.. code:: bash

    tox -e doc

Whenever a change in the documentation is pushed to GitHub, it will be
automatically updated via :command:`travis-sphinx` and is available at:

https://opensource.suse.com/kiwi
